<h1>AI in Software Engineering Education</h1>

<img width="300px" class="rounded float-start pe-4" src="../img/AI/ChatGPT-Logo.png">

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
Artificial intelligence use was heavily encouraged and required in ICS 314, Software Engineering. We were encouraged to use AI to generate code for quizzes or explaining concepts when learning. I personally heavily dislike using AI when learning. I don’t feel I gain a greater understanding of the topic when using AI to generate answers. For the times I have had to use AI, I used ChatGPT. 
<h2>II. Personal Experience with AI:</h2>
There are many examples in class where we were encouraged to use AI, but for me personally I wouldn’t really want to. Particularly in situations where I am learning, I find the discovery leads to a greater understanding of a topic. This is especially important in checking the efficiency or validity of an idea presented, AI or not. I don’t learn how to evaluate quality or be able to adapt if I don’t understand something well enough. To get into more specific examples:
<ol>
<li>Experience WODs (Work Out of the Day) e.g. E18</li>
WODs were timed programming tests. When I knew what I was doing, I would go straight into doing so. If I was unsure about a part of how to build something, I would spend time researching about the topic to clarify specific details. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
<li>In-class Practice WODs</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, when I knew what I was doing, I would go straight into doing so. If I was unsure about a part of how to build something, I would spend time researching about the topic to clarify specific details. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
<li>In-class WODs</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs and In-class Practice WODs, when I knew what I was doing, I would go straight into doing so. If I was unsure about a part of how to build something, I would spend time researching about the topic to clarify specific details. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
<li>Essays</li>
For writing, I want my own style and voice to shine through. I draft key ideas and speak out loud how I want to talk about the ideas to get the specific phrasing. When writing to express myself, I don’t use AI since how I phrase things is important to me.
<li>Final project</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, In-class Practice WODs, and In-class WODs when I knew what I was doing, I would go straight into doing so. If I was unsure about a part of how to build something, I would spend time researching about the topic to clarify specific details. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
<li>Learning a concept / tutorial</li>
When learning, I use articles, documentation, or tutorial videos to get a better understanding. I prefer working from existing code to break down and understand what it is doing. Once I understand what is going on, I’ll dig into why it was chosen in the way it was. AI doesn’t have logic or reason behind what it develops, nor is it reliable in what it is making. When learning something new, I don’t know whether or not the way being done is best for what I am trying to do. I use the surrounding context or more in depth reasoning and explanations in articles, tutorials, or documentation to develop that further understanding of a topic. Since AI lacks reasoning and reliability, I don’t use it when learning a new concept.
<li>Answering a question in class or in Discord</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, In-class Practice WODs, In-class WODs, and Final project when I knew the answer to a question, I would be able to answer in my own words. If I was unsure how to answer a question, I would spend time researching about the topic to clarify specific details. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
<li>Asking or answering a smart-question</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, In-class Practice WODs, In-class WODs, Final project, and Answering a question in class or in Discord, when I knew the answer to a question, I would be able to answer in my own words. If I was unsure how to answer a question, I would spend time researching the topic to clarify specific details. The smart questions I would formulate I would use to search instead of using AI. For me, it was more efficient to create a search rather than use AI.
Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
Similarly to Learning a concept / tutorial, I don’t trust the results from AI. I don’t trust the example code I found online initially either. However, in articles, documentation, or tutorial, I can use the surrounding explanation of the code to further understand or validate the code. Since AI lacks reasoning and reliability, I don’t use it when creating a code example.
<li>Explaining code</li>
Similarly to Learning a concept / tutorial and Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”, I don’t trust the results from AI. I don’t trust the example code I found online initially either. However, in articles, documentation, or tutorial, I can use the surrounding explanation of the code to further understand. Since AI lacks reliability, I don’t use it when explaining code.
<li>Writing code</li>
Similarly to Learning a concept / tutorial, Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”, and Explaining code I don’t trust the results from AI. From my experience when being told to use AI, it is often incorrect and requires many iterations of changing the prompt to be able to get the resulting code to work. In those cases, it is faster for me to make the edits instead of trying to change the prompt. If I don’t know what edits to make, I don’t understand what I am building well enough to trust the AI generated code in the first place. Since AI lacks reliability, I don’t use it when writing code.
<li>Documenting code</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, In-class Practice WODs, In-class WODs, Final project, Answering a question in class or in Discord, and Asking or answering a smart-question, when I know what the code does, I am able to write about it in my own words. AI is wordier than I prefer for documentation. For me, it was more efficient to write code documentation rather than use AI.
<li>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”</li>
Similarly to Experience WODs, In-class Practice WODs, In-class WODs, Final project, Answering a question in class or in Discord, Asking or answering a smart-question, and Documenting code when I know what is wrong with the code, I am able to fix it myself.  From my experience when being told to use AI, it is often incorrect and requires many iterations of changing the prompt to be able to get the resulting code to work. In those cases, it is faster for me to make the edits instead of trying to change the prompt. If I don’t know what edits to make, I don’t understand the code well enough to trust the AI generated code in the first place. For me, it was more to do quality assurance than use AI.
<li>Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</li>

In those cases, it is faster for me to make the edits instead of trying to change the prompt. If I don’t know what edits to make, I don’t understand the code well enough to trust the AI generated code in the first place. From my experience using AI, it is unreliable to use as a learning source and inefficient to use when coding.

<h2>III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:</h2>
I feel AI has been an incredible detriment to my learning experience. I feel that in order for me to effectively utilize AI, I already need to have a great understanding of the topic I am using it for in order to fact check it. When I have needed further detail or clarifications on topics, just being told to use AI on the code has been very unhelpful. I am fundamentally unsure of what is occurring and I am still unsure of the validity of AI’s answer. When I was required to use AI to develop code for an assignment, I didn’t understand the result it produced and could not iterate or validate it. I didn’t feel I had developed a greater understanding of how to tackle the problem at all, as even if I was faced with a similar problem I had no better understanding of the concept when just using AI.  
<h2>IV. Practical Applications:</h2>
I feel that AI is a tool similar to code itself that is used to do a process more efficiently. For example, when I need boilerplate code for simple graphs, I’ll start with AI and then heavily edit it from there. For me, AI saves typing time like how code saves time doing calculations efficiently. 
<h2>V. Challenges and Opportunities:</h2>
I would liken AI to code in how potentially time saving and useful it could be, however the unreliability of AI is what I feel is its most severe limitation. AI in its current state can and is often wrong in what it confidently presents as fact and functional. Students learning new concepts wouldn’t have the depth of understanding to be able to pinpoint or even identify errors in AI generated code or explanation.
<h2>VI. Comparative Analysis:</h2>
Between traditional teaching methods and AI-enhanced approaches in the context of software engineering education, I believe that traditional teaching methods far better help students engage, retain knowledge, and develop practical skills. When using AI, I felt heavily disconnected from the material I was learning. I was teaching the AI how to solve problems by prompting it until it was able to generate code to function. I wasn’t creating, learning, or understanding the code AI was generating. I was learning how to prompt an AI to learn, not how to ask myself questions for me to better understand. The prompts would help the AI generate better code, but the prompts weren’t geared in a way to help me create better code. I feel that for learning software engineering skills, traditional teaching methods that are geared towards challenging the student to create software are far more effective at engagement, knowledge retention, and practical skill development than pushing students to use AI.
<h2>VII. Future Considerations:</h2>
I think that students shouldn’t use AI for learning software engineering. When using AI for new material, I felt I was learning how to help the AI grow and understand the underlying material, not myself, the student. Where I do see a future of AI in software engineering education is on the educators side. AI becomes a great tool more flexible than code and quite quick in making things such as assignments, quizzes, test cases, outlining tutorials, etc. The educator has the depth of understanding to know if the AI has made any errors in the development of code or an explanation. AI is quick at creating things once prompted, so more practice problems and lessons can be created by educators making use of AI.
<h2>VIII. Conclusion:</h2>
AI is a great tool for quickly creating mockups. It’s able to create things fast with a loose prompt. The messiness and unreliability of the answer it creates makes it dangerous for students learning new material. On the other hand, the quick generation makes it great for professionals who already know what they want. I feel that AI should be used on the educators side to be able to more quickly create materials for learning, but not for students who don’t understand the topic.
