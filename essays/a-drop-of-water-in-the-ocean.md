<h1>The Great Time Sink</h1>

Once code is finally done and it feels like a sigh of relief can be breathed, there’s another wave of work to drag a programmer under: documentation. Good documentation is a huge time sink. It’s writing an essay to explain the code itself after it finally works. Things such as comments, how a variable is named, and spacing between characters or lines don’t really matter to a computer. The program will run all the same with good or bad coding standards. Documentation feels unnecessarily draining when turning in classwork, because code freezes once turned in. But coding doesn’t happen only in the classroom.

<h1>The Commotion in the Ocean</h1>

When working on larger projects with multiple components and collaborators, a piece of code written doesn’t start or end with one person. The prompt of what to create is never given as cleanly as in a sterile classroom environment. What the end goal is changes over time, whether that be due to a change of direction, clarification, or realization of an issue. If code could exist frozen in time where it never needed to be changed, then there would be no reason for anyone to understand what it does or why. However, we live in the ever changing tides in the stream of life, and so we must be able to go along with the flow.

<h1>The Change Along with the Tides </h1>

Not if, but when code needs to be debugged, modified, or used by someone else it’ll have to be read again to be unfrozen from its original state and sculpted new once again. All the time poured into the documentation will be a well of knowledge for the next person. Good documentation is an absolute pain for the writer, but a life raft for the reader.
