<h1>Overview: Rate My TA</h1>

<h2>The Problem: Who's the TA?</h2>
Class registration season is always a bit nerve wracking, since the next couple months are determined by the class structure, professor, and teacher assistant (TA). I personally spend a good bit of time asking around about a class I’m planning to take to students who already have or read reviews online. While there are sites like rate my professor to see how a professor might be, there isn’t a great way to research the TA’s ahead of time.

<h2>The Solution: Rate My TA</h2>
So I think creating a website allows TA's can write about their plans for a class and students can post reviews of their TA’s. This would be beneficial for students when deciding classes and sections they want to take to read ahead of time about their TA’s. 

<h1>Mockup Page Ideas</h1>
Some pages for this site could be:
<ol>
<li>Home page </li>
<li>TA admin home page</li>
<li>TA class page </li>
<li>Browse classes</li>
<li>Login page</li>
</ol>

<h1>Use case ideas</h1>
Some ways this site could be used are:
<ol>
<li>A student looks at the home page, goes to browse classes, and then looks at the TA class page of a class they are interested in </li>
<li>A student starts on the home page, logs in with their student id, then goes to browse classes and then look at the TA class page of a class they took to write a review</li>
<li>A TA starts on home page, logs in, and creates a class page for their class</li>
</ol>

<h1>Beyond the Basics</h1>
More advance features that could be helpful as well are:
<ol>
<li>Students being able to bookmark classes they are interested in</li>
<li>TA’s being able to take down student comments </li>
<li>Implementing a rating system of the TA’s classes</li>
</ol>
