<h1>How Much Time Will That Take You?</h1>

<h2>How long will that take?</h2>

At the first internship I ever worked at, my non technical manager threw me a curveball that class hadn’t prepared me for up to that point. Instead of being given a deadline of when to turn in a feature, I was asked how long it would take to develop. I was working with many of the different design and marketing teams as well, so giving them a timeline to help us all coordinate work would be helpful. But since I was developing a new feature that I was unfamiliar with, I had absolutely no clue how long it would take to make.

<h2>How long should that take?</h2>

Since then, I have made a conscious effort of making a note of how long different developmental tasks take. I generally set aside a block of time to work, like from 4:00pm-5:30pm, and within that time, I would check the clock to see how long I spent typing out the code to make the feature. Using the time I started working on a feature and the time I finished it helped me develop a more accurate idea of how long features take to develop. Once I knew how to make something, it would only take a couple of minutes to actually get the feature created. The typing part of coding only takes a couple of minutes.

<h2>How long does it take to make something new?</h2>

What I have learned as I have started working on more new projects is to include the learning time as well. Knowing how the final code is supposed to be written like in a class assignment is a very small part of coding. Most of the time I spend working on a new feature is first trying to figure out how to do so. The research process of reading documentation, finding relevant examples, and watching tutorials, also takes time in developing a feature from start to finish. It’s not typing in a development environment directly, but it is part of how long I will take to develop a feature nonetheless.
