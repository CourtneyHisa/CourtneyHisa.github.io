Everyone is expected to answer the same problems the same way for most assignments in class. The assignment will have clear step by step instructions on “what to do”, “how to do it”, and “when it’s due”. 

<ul>
      <li>I was told to write a function.</li>
      <li>I was told to write in javascript.</li>
      <li>I was told to write in class.</li>
</ul>

So on and so forth I continued to slog through all my various similar school work.

It wasn’t until being given a very open ended assignment that I was asking myself the “why”. Because when given the freedom to create anything, it’s harder to choose something.

<ul>
      <li>I wasn’t told exactly what to write</li>
      <li>I wasn’t told exactly how to write</li>
      <li>I wasn’t told exactly when to write</li>
</ul>

All I had was me, myself, and a new question, “why?” 

<ul>
      <li>Why did I write a function?</li>
      <li>Why did I write in javascript?</li>
      <li>Why did I write in class?</li>
</ul>

And instead of writing, I went back and read. I slowed down to read the past to write for the future, my future. 
Because as much as anything is possible, there is a reason why that something was chosen.

So thanks past me it was fun to read your whys, and I’ll probably come back to this some time in the future to read again once more.
