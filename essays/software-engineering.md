<h2>The Developmental Process</h2>
The final iteration doesn’t come about on the first go around. Like many processes, software development is a journey. The quality and continued life of a software is dependent on how it was created. Both the management of the code itself and the people working on the code are vital to software engineering.

<h2>Coding Standards</h2>
Computers will run code the same when it is written in many different ways, but people will read code differently than the computer. Not if, but when changes need to be made on an ongoing project, code will be read and then modified. Having standards set in place for how the code reads like naming conventions, formatting, and use of functions, helps make the code readable to other members of the team.

<h2>Agile Project Management</h2>
There are many ways to tackle a problem, one method commonly used in software development is agile project management. Agile project management is a methodology to take the overall project and break it down into smaller individual tasks. These smaller tasks can be divided amongst team members, so everyone can be working without conflicting with one another.
