<h1> AI Can Do Everything You Can? So Why Code? </h1>

Why study computer science? The job market has only taken a downward spiraling turn around me as AI takes over. This would be great if I wished to develop AI, but that isn’t my goal. What I am debating between is software development or data science; both of which have outlooks of being replaced in different capacities in the future I am currently faced with. If I wish to take on the world as it evolves around me, I’ll need to further hone a different set of skills than just technical software development. Since, at the end of the day, code is a tool used by people to get something done. 

<h2> The Coding People </h2>

Coding in classes a lot of the time would just be:

```
Here is the prompt
```

```
And write your code here
```

With a fancy little <button type="button">Turn In</button> button, and then on to the next module. 

However, coding in a project with other people, the code doesn’t end with the person who made it. Someone else has to read the code, someone else has to understand the code, and some one else has to with other pieces. Code in a project doesn’t disappear off into no where land once it is handed off. All the little quirks, single letter variables, hard coded constants, and not a comment in sight don’t matter to a computer one bit at all. Though it matters to the next coder who has to use it. AI can generate tons and tons of code, but useable code is a different story. I want to learn and hone my skills in being able to work with other developers.
